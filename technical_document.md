# Document Conversion System: Technical Document

## Design Patterns Selection and Implementation

### Selected Design Patterns

For the document conversion system, I implemented two primary design patterns:

1. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Implemented through the `DocumentConverter` abstract base class and its concrete implementations
   - Each converter strategy encapsulates a specific conversion algorithm
   - Allows adding new conversion strategies without modifying existing code

2. **Factory Pattern**
   - Implemented through the `ConverterFactory` class
   - Centralizes the creation of converter objects
   - Provides a registration mechanism for new converters
   - Decouples client code from specific converter implementations

### SOLID Principles Implementation

The implementation adheres to SOLID principles in the following ways:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each converter class has a single responsibility: converting from one specific format to another
   - The factory is responsible only for creating appropriate converters
   - The main system class orchestrates the conversion process

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - The system is open for extension (new converters can be added) but closed for modification
   - Adding new format converters doesn't require changing existing code
   - The registration mechanism allows extending functionality without modifying core classes

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - All concrete converters can be used interchangeably through the `DocumentConverter` interface
   - The system works with the abstract base class, not specific implementations

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - The `DocumentConverter` interface is minimal, requiring only a `convert` method
   - No converter is forced to implement methods it doesn't need

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - The `DocumentConversionSystem` depends on the abstract `DocumentConverter` interface
   - Specific converter implementations are injected through the factory

### Trade-offs and Alternatives Considered

1. **Trade-offs**
   - **Simplicity vs. Flexibility**: The current design favors flexibility over simplicity, which adds some complexity
   - **Performance**: The factory pattern adds a small overhead but provides significant benefits in maintainability
   - **Memory Usage**: Registering all converters at startup uses more memory but improves runtime performance

2. **Alternatives Considered**
   - **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Could be used to try different converters in sequence, but would be less efficient
   - **Adapter Pattern**: Considered for adapting third-party libraries, which would be valuable in a production system
   - **Builder Pattern**: Could be useful for complex document conversions requiring multiple steps
   - **Direct instantiation**: Simpler but would violate OCP and create tight coupling

### Extensibility Support

The design supports future extensibility in several ways:

1. **Adding New Formats**
   - Create a new converter class implementing the `DocumentConverter` interface
   - Register the new converter with the factory
   - No changes needed to existing code

2. **Supporting Format Variations**
   - Specialized converters can be created for specific format variations
   - The factory key can be extended to include version information or specific parameters

3. **Integration with External Libraries**
   - Concrete converter implementations can wrap third-party libraries
   - The abstract interface shields the rest of the system from external dependencies

4. **Conversion Pipelines**
   - The system could be extended to support multi-step conversions (e.g., PDF → Text → HTML)
   - This could be achieved by composing converters or adding a dedicated pipeline class

5. **Configuration and Customization**
   - The factory registration mechanism could be extended to support configuration parameters
   - This would allow customizing conversion behavior without creating new classes

The implementation provides a solid foundation that can evolve with changing requirements while maintaining a clean architecture and separation of concerns.
